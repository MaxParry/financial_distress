                            <p>Deciding whether to secure a loan from a bank is a big decision. You need mo’ money, but will you get it? We help you figure it out.</p>

                        <div class=''>
                            <h2>How we do</h2>
                            <p>We took a dataset describing 150K loans. It gave info about the borrowers like age, monthly income, and number of dependents. It also told us if the borrower couldn’t pay back the loan within 2 years. We used this to build a model that predicts whether or not a bank will give you a loan.</p>

                            <h3>The Down and Dirty</h3>
                            <p>Even the best machine learning models suffer if the data is riding dirty. You gotta make it fresh son.</p>
                            <p>Important note (we about to get technical): we evaluated our models based on AUC. Because loan defaults were so rare in the dataset, the model would have 93% accuracy if it always predicted ‘no default’.</p>

                            <p>Because of this class imbalance, we plotted an ROC curve and calculated AUC to assess model performance. This is the ROC curve of a logistic regression model, before cleaning:</p>

                                <li>Dropping entire rows of data gives us less data to play wit</li>
                                <li>Instead we replaced that data using averages or medians (for income, we averaged by age). This is the ROC curve of a logistic regression model, after cleaning:</li>

                                <li>Tried to create new features based on common sense (using the info we already got). This is the ROC curve of a logistic regression model, after new features are added:</li>
